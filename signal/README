This directory provides a signal implementation, which is appropriate
for operating systems where signals are managed at user-level.  It is
up to the run-time to catch the signals and forward them to the
implementation via, e.g., the pthread_kill_info_np call.

This implementation was once used for a native port running on L4, but is not
currently used in any libpthread port bundled in this release.
