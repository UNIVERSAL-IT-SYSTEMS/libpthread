Subject: [PATCH] Make libpthread buildable stand-alone.
    
From: Thomas Schwinge <thomas@schwinge.name>

* AUTHORS: New file.
* COPYING: Likewise.
* NEWS: Likewise.
* README: Likewise.
* configure.ac: Likewise.
* package.m4: Likewise.
* Makefile.am: Merge stuff from Makefile.  Switch to using libtool for building
both static and shared libraries for the GNU system.  Use libtool's versioning
infrastructure, but maintain a compatibility symlink for the shared library.
