From: Thomas Schwinge <thomas@schwinge.name>

* AUTHORS: New file.
* COPYING: Likewise.
* NEWS: Likewise.
* README: Likewise.
* configure.ac: Likewise.
* package.m4: Likewise.
* Makefile: Remove file after having merged essential parts into...
* Makefile.am: ... here.  Switch to using libtool for building both static and
shared libraries for the GNU system.  Use libtool's versioning infrastructure,
but maintain a compatibility symlink for the shared library.
